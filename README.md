AquaOptiSense – Water Distribution System Optimization
Bangalore Water Distribution System Optimization using Genetic Algorithm and EPANET Simulation
Overview

AquaOptiSense is a full water distribution system (WDS) optimization project that uses:

EPANET hydraulic simulation

Genetic Algorithm (GA)

Real ward-level demand & supply data

Interactive visualization dashboard (frontend)

The goal is to reduce shortage, improve pressure, and analyze hydraulic performance efficiently.
